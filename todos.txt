Research weather derivatives
    Distinction between quant research in academia vs in industry - 
        Aim: Go for a industry focused approach, a lot can be published, better to have something useful which can then be published if appropriate
        
    Derivative Pricing
        I need to understand derivatives, put and call options and collar
        What we use the climate models for will be determined by the our chosen underlying for our derivative contracts 
        HDD/CDD call with cap, so number of degree days minus a strike price

    Climate modelling

        https://accord.edu.so/course/material/advanced-statistics-for-finance-78/pdf_content

        Use Gaussian processes, maybe encode uncertainty due to the distance into the model
        Use parameteric time series models
        Can also apply Monte Carlo Simulation of weather events to test performance of model

        Time Series Model
        Fourier Series Model
        Stochastic differential equation Model - 
            Requires seasonal modelling of the variance/volatility of temperature
            Use paper (2) and quantPy for motivation

        Gaussian Process Model
        Neural Network Time Series
        
        Account for the distance between the weather recording stations and location of the contract holder
            We can actually quantify this as MetOffice data is on a 1km square precision
            "Basis Risk"

    Find out how data is collected, either at stations or using satellites per square kilometer
    Plot a 10x10 1km squared grid and look at auto correlations between the squares and backwards in time too
    Consider some (e.g. linear) interpolation

    Correlation between HDDs over adjacent months (e.g.) comparison to contracts over the months separately/together
    How to price these correlation contracts

    "The relationship between pricing at different time scales can discover fundamental pricing disparities in weather contracts. A major utility recently found that it was cheaper to cover their winter season by buying a series of monthly contracts rather than buying a single contract for the whole season. In this situation, the market had not efficiently priced the risk associated with these options. A market participant who bought the individual months and financed this purchase by selling a single contract for the entire period should reap a significant profit in this situation."

    What does this mean?
    "This brief discussion of some of the challenges in pricing weather derivatives suggests that care must be taken in the theoretical pricing of these options. As the exchange-traded market gets underway, the market will increasingly provide price discovery so that in-depth analysis is not required of all participants. There are a number of market makers who have been working these issues extensively in the OTC market â€” and the price-discovery function of these large players is already evident in weather option prices."

    Weather conditions rarely affect price of commodities directly but instead the volume. This makes correlation trading more difficult. For example, weather conditions can affect the yield of crops or demand of electricity but not the price directly.

    Today on statistical models, I also need to get my hands on an actual weather derivatives contract (since traded on CME).
    Tomorrow: Research papers on weather derivatives, find out how climate data is sourced by the MetOffice and look at climate papers of more complicated weather models.
