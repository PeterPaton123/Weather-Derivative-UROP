    "# Modelling with Stochastic Differential Equations\n",

    "Firstly, I will consider an Ornstein-Ulhenbeck process for time series modelling. OU processes are mean-reverting which means they tend toward their mean.\n",

    "$$ dX_{t} = -\\alpha(x - \\mu) dt + \\sigma dW_{t}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we found in modelling the mean, the asymptotic mean of our process varies over time, this is $\\mu(t) \\neq \\mu$. However, if we substitute this into our formulation, we will see the expectation of our process is $\\neq \\mu(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will first demonstrate the expectation of the stochastic process,\n",
    "$$ dX_{t} = \\alpha(\\mu(t) - X_{t}) dt + \\sigma_{t}dW_{t},~\\alpha > 0.$$\n",

    "The issue with the expectation arises from the quantity $\\alpha \\int_{t_{0}}^{t} e^{\\alpha z} \\mu(z) dz$. I will demonstrate this by integration by parts, taking $u = \\mu(t),~v'=e^{\\alpha t} \\implies u' = \\dot{\\mu}(t),~v=\\alpha^{-1}e^{\\alpha t}$.\n",

Therefore, we find that $1 - \\alpha = \\theta$ in the AR(1) model of the residuals. This is how we can determine the rate of mean reversion, $\\alpha$.\n",
